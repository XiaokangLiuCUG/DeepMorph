# DeepMorph
Morphological analysis of the latest Permian to earliest Triassic marine fossils. 1.) We collected the fossil images from publications; 2) U2-Net is used to extract the binary images; 3) ammonoids_landmarks.py can extract the contours of fossils and we used geometric morphometrics to get landmarks and semi-landmarks, and coordinates will be saved for morphological analyze; 4) alignment of specimens is based on R package, i.e., geomorph, then we used disparity for morphological quantification.
