# DeepMorph
Morphological analysis of the latest Permian to earliest Triassic marine fossils. 1.) We collected the fossil images from publications; 2) U2-Net is used to extract the binary images; 3) ammonoids_landmarks.py can extract the contours of fossils and we used geometric morphometrics to get landmarks and semi-landmarks, and coordinates will be saved for morphological analyze; 4) alignment of specimens is based on R package, i.e., geomorph, then we used disparity for morphological quantification.

## How to use DeepMorph
1. Prepare the DeepMorph environment based on the requirements.txt
2. U2-Net is used to segment fossil areas by running the u2net_test.py. Please add your path of the model and image file
 ```
python path_to_env/u2net_test.py
```
3. Then, the contours of the fossil can be extracted using ammonoids_landmarks.py. ps change to your path of the binary image file obtained from the second step. Fossil contours will be saved as coordinates in a CSV file. Among them, four landmarks and 60 will be extracted as shown in the figure above (trait matrix). 
 ```
python path_to_env/u2net_test.py 
```
4. Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) was then conducted to align shells and remove the size effect, then we can calculate the disparity of different subsets, as demonstrated in PT_ammonoids_disparity.R
